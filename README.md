Important/instructions : to make the code a file you will need pyothon/visual studio code to place and save you're code

little keylogger i made and wanted to make open open source (this whole thing is self explanatory if you know what you are doing)

once done open up the windows terminal and enter the code (python -m PyInstaller --onefile (your file name).py
                                                            example: python -m PyInstaller --onefile hello.py  
                                                            you could also add your own ico (file icon pitcutre) 
enter you're discord webhook inside of #12

what does this logs:

website visits ┃ users clipbord ┃ user messages ┃ everytime users clicks anything ┃ and more activity 
(didn't figure to add a kill switch so the only way this can be turned off is the webhook gets deleted or the user deletes the file themselfs)
